    <h2>
      A Little Bit About Me
    </h2>

    <p id="introduction">
      I am a recent graduate of Concordia University's Computation Arts Specialization that thrives on coming up with new ideas. From elaborate narratives to supplementary game mechanics, I pride myself on having an abundant imagination that can brainstorm on the fly as well as being able to take ideas to the distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio will serve as a simple repository of my work and will include everything from revamped school projects to game jam submissions. As my professional interests lie within narrative and game design, most of my work will pertain to those, bar a few projects.
    </p>

    <p>This page is currently a little bit barren, but there is definitely more to come! Thank you for taking an interest in my work! While I continue building up my presence online, please check out some of the project I currently have:</p>
